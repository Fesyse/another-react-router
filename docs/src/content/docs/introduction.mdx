title: Introduction
description: Another react router is a npm package, that allowes developers and users comfortable route between pages on their web applications built with react.
---

## Why

This project is inspired by [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/) file based router.

So why then dont use **react router** or **NEXT.js** then?

The idea behind another react router to combine react router simpleness and NEXT.js file routing for developers a better DX. It is also perfect choice for people that want to stay away from **RSC**, but want to try file based routing with blazingly fast bundler's like **vite**.

## Features

- **Route Configuration**: Define routes in a multiple files and make your own infastructure, making it easy to manage and maintain your application
- **Typesafe**: Router is fully typesafe out of the box, even the **Link** href attribute (see [docs](/docs/components/link))

		Why choose NEXT.js for this website instead of using your's package?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
There was a quite hard decision between **VitePress**, **Docusaurus** and **NEXT.js** (contentlayer).

First of VitePress:

- Does not use React. Vue is not bad my any means, great tool overall but we dont feel like it
- We are did not quite liked theme of site, and customizing it was really painfull

Docusaurus:

The structure of a project was really quite strange, for me it was really not enjoying building project

NEXT.js:

- Our team is used to project infastructure of NEXT.js applications
- Good CEO support
- RSC (even tho package does not support RSC, but we are really like this tool)

	<AccordionTrigger>
		Why use CLI for generating routes from routes directory?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
		Unlike **NEXT.js** we are using [CLI](/docs/cli) to generate routes in
		config, that's because of some [Node.js](https://nodejs.com/) **path and
		fs** packages that runs **only on Node.js runtime**. That means theres no
		way to get routes from **routes directory** on browser runtime. Hope that
		helps understanding this concept.
