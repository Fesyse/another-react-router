You might be asking: where is `Link` component in package?

Answer: it's not in package, it's in your app. You need to create it.

Just copy and paste following code

```tsx title="/src/routes/home-page.tsx" /HrefType/
import type { FC, DetailedHTMLProps, AnchorHTMLAttributes } from "react"
import { type HrefType } from "another-react-router.config.ts"

export const Link: FC<
  DetailedHTMLProps<
    AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>,
    HTMLAnchorElement
  > & { href?: HrefType }
> = props => <a {...props} />
```

Only difference between `Link` component and `a` tag is `href` prop. In `a` tag `href` prop is type of `string`, but in our implementation it is `HrefType` which is generated by cli in `config`.

Read more information about `HrefType` in [config](/docs/config).
