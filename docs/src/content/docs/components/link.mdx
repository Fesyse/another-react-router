You might be asking: where is `Link` component in package?

Answer: it's not in package, it's in your app. You need to create it.

Just copy and paste following code

```tsx title="/src/routes/home-page.tsx" /HrefType/
import {
	type HrefType,
	type LinkComponent
} from "another-react-router.config.ts"
import type { AnchorHTMLAttributes, DetailedHTMLProps, FC } from "react"

export const Link: LinkComponent<HrefType> = props => <a {...props} />
```

`<Link>` is a component that can be created by yourself it extends \<a> tag with typesafe `href` prop. Use this component **only** if you are planning on using to route **inside of your application**. I mean that if you want to navigate to **other website** just use \<a> tag, otherwise you will get `TS error` that says:

<Callout className="mt-6" variant="destructive">
**Type Error**: Type \<YOUR_HREF_TYPE> is not assignable to type \<HREF_TYPE>.
</Callout>

Read more information about `HrefType` in [config](/docs/config).
