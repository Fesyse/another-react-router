                         "CWD_PATH")

```

### Tips

#### Watching for file changes in parallel

If you want to watch for file changes in your routes directory, you can use the `-w` flag on `init` command
But what if you want to watch in parallel with your bundler do it's work?

You can update your `scripts` in `package.json` (vite example, replace vite for your bundler that will work in watch mode)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "sh -c 'vite && npm run another-react-router init --watch'"
  }
}
```
