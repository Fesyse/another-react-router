## Creating Routes

Another react router uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes.

Each folder represents a [**route** segment](/docs/routing#route-segments) that maps to a **URL** segment. To create a [nested route](/docs/routing#nested-routes), you can nest folders inside each other.

<Image
	alt="Route segments to path segments"
	src="/route-segments-to-path-segments.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="594"
/>

A special [`page.js` file](/docs/routing/pages) is used to make route segments publicly accessible.

<Image
	alt="Defining Routes"
	src="/defining-routes.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="687"
/>

In this example, the `/dashboard/analytics` URL path is _not_ publicly accessible because it does not have a corresponding `page.js` file. This folder could be used to store components, stylesheets, images, or other colocated files.

> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `ts` or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.

## Creating UI

[Special file conventions](/docs/routing#file-conventions) are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common are [pages](/docs/routing/pages) to show UI unique to a route, and [layouts](/docs/routing/layouts) to show UI that is shared across multiple routes.

For example, to create your first page, add a `page.js` file inside the `routes directory` and export a React component:

```tsx title="/src/routes/page.tsx"
export default function Page() {
	return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```
