## Terminology

First, you will see these terms being used throughout the documentation. Here's a quick reference:

- Tree: A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.
- Subtree: Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).
- Root: The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.
- Leaf: Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.

- URL Segment: Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.
- URL Path: Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).

## Roles of Folders and Files

Another react router uses a file-system based router where:

- Folders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a `page.(js/ts/jsx/tsx)` file. See Defining Routes.
- Files are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See special files.

## Route Segments

Each folder in a route represents a route segment. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

## Nested Routes

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two new folders in the `routes directory`.

The /dashboard/settings route is composed of three segments:

- `/` (Root segment)
- `dashboard` (Segment)
- `settings` (Leaf segment)

## File Conventions

Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

|                                                             |                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`layout`](/docs/app/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) | Shared UI for a segment and its children                 |
| [`page`](/docs/app/routing/pages)                           | Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible |
| [`not-found`](/docs/app/routing/not-found)                  | Not found UI for a segment and its children              |

> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.

## Component Hierarchy

The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

- `layout.js`
- `not-found.js` (React error boundary)
- `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

In a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

## Colocation

In addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the `app` directory.

This is because while folders define routes, only the contents returned by `page.js` or `route.js` are publicly addressable.
