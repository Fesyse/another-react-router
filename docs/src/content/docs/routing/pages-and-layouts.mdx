## Page

A page is UI that is **unique** to a route. You can define a page by default exporting a component from a `page.js` file.

For example, to create your `index` page, add the `page.js` file inside the `app` directory:

<Image
	alt="page.js special file"
	src="/page-special-file.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="444"
/>

```tsx title="/src/routes/page.tsx"
// `/src/routes/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/` URL
export default function Page() {
	return <h1>Hello, Home page!</h1>
}
```

Then, to create further pages, create a new folder and add the `page.js` file inside it. For example, to create a page for the `/dashboard` route, create a new folder called `dashboard`, and add the `page.js` file inside it:

```tsx title="/src/routes/dashboard/page.tsx"
// `/src/routes/dashboard/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/dashboard` URL
export default function Page() {
	return <h1>Hello, Dashboard Page!</h1>
}
```

## Layouts

The special file [layout.js](#layouts) allow you to create UI that is shared between [routes](/docs//routing/defining-routes#creating-routes).

A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be [nested](#nesting-layouts).

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a `layout.js` file. The component should accept a `children` prop that will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.

For example, the layout will be shared with the `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/settings` pages:

<Image
	alt="layout.js special file"
	src="/layout-special-file.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="606"
/>

```tsx title="/src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx"
export default function DashboardLayout({
	children // will be a page or nested layout
}: React.PropsWithChildren) {
	return (
		<section>
			{/* Include shared UI here e.g. a header or sidebar */}
			<nav></nav>

			{children}
		</section>
	)
}
```

### Nesting Layouts

By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are **nested**, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout.js` inside specific route segments (folders).

For example, to create a layout for the `/dashboard` route, add a new `layout.js` file inside the `dashboard` folder:

<Image
	alt="Nested Layout"
	src="/nested-layout.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="606"
/>

```tsx title="/src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx"
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) {
	return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`/src/routes/layout.js`) would wrap the dashboard layout (`/src/routes/dashboard/layout.js`), which would wrap route segments inside `/src/routes/dashboard/*`.

The two layouts would be nested as such:

<Image
	alt="Nested Layouts"
	src="/nested-layouts-ui.avif"
	width="1600"
	height="1026"
/>

> **Good to know**
>
> - When a `layout.js` and `page.js` file are defined in the same folder, the layout will wrap the page.
> - `.js`, `.jsx`, `ts` or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.
